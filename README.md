## Zomato Core Database Schema Highlights

The schema is designed to handle high transaction loads and ensure data consistency across different modules:

| Entity                         | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Users**                      | Manages customer profiles, preferences, and addresses.                     |
| **Restaurants**                | Contains restaurant details, cuisines, hygiene ratings, and addresses.     |
| **MenuItems**                  | Items available in each restaurant with pricing and dietary category tags. |
| **Orders & OrderItems**        | Tracks complete orders and individual items per order for group ordering.  |
| **Payments**                   | Manages flexible payment methods and statuses.                             |
| **DeliveryPersons & Delivery** | Delivery partner tracking, route optimization, and real-time status.       |
